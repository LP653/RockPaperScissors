# RockPaperScissors

This is my first successful attempt at the Rock Paper Scissors project for the Odin Project's JavaScript section.

I fullfilled all the requirements and implemented a round choosing system.

As specified, the program does not consider if users enter incorrect information. I hope to return to address this.
