# RockPaperScissors

This is my rework of the Rock Paper Scissors project from the Odin Project.

I elected to put nearly all the elements in the `script.js` file using the DOM, as this was for the JavaScript section of the Foundations course.

I intend to rework later on but for now this is a 'good enough' attempt with.

It is able to run multiple games, I might add functionality to customize the number of points to win.
